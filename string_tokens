/*
Given a string s, matching the regular expression [A-Za-z !,?._'@]+, split the string into tokens. 
We define a token to be one or more consecutive English alphabetic letters. 
Then, print the number of tokens, followed by each token on a new line.

Output Format:
On the first line, print an integer n, denoting the number of tokens in string s (they do not need to be unique). 
Next, print each of the n tokens on a new line in the same order as they appear in input string .

Sample Input:
He is a very very good boy, isn't he?

Sample Output:
10
He
is
a
very
very
good
boy
isn
t
he
